# Web-scraper

## Project Structure

###### The project is composed of several key components that come together for web scraping and distributed task processing using Celery.

* **scrape.py:** Contains code for extracting car data from the auto.ria.com website using the Selenium library.
* **db.py:** Includes code for interacting with a PostgreSQL database where information about cars is stored.
* **tasks.py:** Houses functions and Celery configurations for distributed task processing. It includes tasks for scraping (perform_scrape) and backing up the database (perform_database_dump).
* **docker-compose.yml:** The Docker Compose configuration file for creating and launching containers, including Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL, and Selenium.
* **.env**: Environment variable files containing configuration parameters for the project and Docker.
* **dumps/:** Directory for storing backups of the database.

## Running Instructions

###### Make environment variables are correctly configured before running the project. Replace the values in the sample .env file with your actual credentials and configuration.
